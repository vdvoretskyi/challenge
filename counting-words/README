Word Count
----------

Write a quick and dirty program (Shell, Python, Perl, Java, Lisp, C++, APL, or
whatever) to produce a count of all the different "words" in a text file. Use
any definition of word that makes logical sense or makes your job easy.  The
output might look like this:

    6 a
    14 the
    9 of
    9 in
    8 com
    7 you
    7 that
    7 energy
    6 to
    ...

For this input file, the word "a" occured 17 times, "the" 14 times, etc.
